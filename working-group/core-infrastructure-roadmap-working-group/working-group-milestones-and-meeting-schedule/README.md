The Core Infrastructure Roadmap working group's mission is to foster a transparent, inclusive, and adaptable core infrastructure roadmap for the decentralized development of Cardano as an open-source blockchain and maintain its competitiveness.

To fulfill this mission, the working group has set several goals that needs to be looked into, namely Vocabulary & Definitions, Communication Plan, The Process, and Vision.

As this is an iterative process, the schedule below will be subject to change according to the evolving needs of the working group. &#x20;

## Key Milestones

The working group has outlined several key milestones to be achieved over the next 3 to 4 months. These milestones serve as initial benchmarks to guide the group's progress towards their goals. As the group advances, these milestones will be further refined and become more concrete.

1. **May:**&#x20;
   * Create Rough Draft of Comms Plan
   * Communicate our mission and goals for community review
   * Submit Vocab to community for review
   * Work with Current Projects on Comms plan
   * Have all core infra TWGs set up at Intersect: Networking (active), Plutus Core (active), Consensus, Ledger, Node/CLI, , Hydra, Mithril
   * TImebound feedback from Community
2. **June:**&#x20;
   * Create Rough Map of Current State
   * Initiate triage of Cardano Continuity list including Community members
   * Publish a first roadmap process
   * Get buyin from Current projects on Communications Plan
   * Ecosystem Wide Communication Plan
   * Ask core infra TWGs to produce their respective backlogs (including maintenance) and vote-for/include CIPs, CPS that they believe are priorities for them to implement
   * Work with Current Projects on Map of Current state
   * Socialize Comms Plan at intersect
   * Roadmap Tiers defined and refined
   * Encourage Current Projects to talk about Live Communications plan
   * Ask Research Labs (through IOG) to present their Research agenda for the next 5-7 years
   * Publish Current State Maps for community feedback
   * Incorporate Feedback
   * socialised 'list' with measures applied for now and near-term items
3. **July:**&#x20;
   * Create Rough Journey Map of Possible Future state State
   * Submit to Community again for time bound feedback
   * Publish a first roadmap proposal
   * Publish as Living Doc (living doc in Git for versioning and suggestions)
   * Socialize Journey Map to Community for feedback
   * Checkpoint to ensure correct TWGs are set up and ranked as needed
   * Create Rough Journey Map of Possible Future state State
4. **Aug:**&#x20;
   * Walkthru on how items in CIP, CPS, SIGs appear on complete backlog
   * Publish 'cheat sheets' on how SIG is set up and what workflow is
   * Journey Map slicing Approach
5. **Sept:**
   * Name CIP Reviewer
   * CIP Reviewer reviews existing CIPs and evaluates what should be next
6. **Oct:**
   * Annual Members Meeting (AMM)

These milestones provide a structured framework for the group to follow, ensuring that efforts are coordinated and focused on achieving the set goals. Regular reviews and adjustments will ensure that the group remains on track and can adapt to any emerging challenges or opportunities.

## Outline Meeting Schedule

To assure success and velocity of the working group, a simple ethos has been devised. Every session starts and ends with a defined outcome that contributes to the overall process. For example, one outcome of the first session would be to take one item to the working group, e.g. log-structured merge-tree (LSM tree), and challenge if the item is defined enough to be considered, compared and sorted.&#x20;
