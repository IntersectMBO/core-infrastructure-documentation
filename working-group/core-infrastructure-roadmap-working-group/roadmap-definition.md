## Introduction

Roadmap is an inventory of essential services that support vital economic and social activities within Cardano. It supports the essential building blocks upon which the next layer of abstraction supporting Builders and enabling DApps. The definition of Roadmap (COREINF) will change upon agreement with the 'Technical Steering Committee (TSC), associated Technical Working Groups (TWG) and the Cardano Infrastructure Roadmap Working Group (CIR-WG).

Whilst not exhaustive, this contains Cardano Node, Plutus, Cardano wallet, agreed tools or low-level enabling; it is envisaged that determination of what is "Roadmap" is part of the 'triage' where incoming proposals are tested against a growing list of 'Roadmap'. It is reasonable to expect that a combination of TSC, CIR-WG and TWGs will converge upon a non-moving definition after an agreed period.

### How are items Triaged and what format are those accepted in?

Items inbound will be accepted as four key items defined below and will be received into github (or other agreed inbound route e.g. email):

| Type | Short                       | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| CIP  | Cardano Improvement Process | This is more of a technical change initiated by an individual or someone representing an organization/group. A CIP is a document starting in a draft phase before being refined and promoted to 'review/accepted' state based on agreed completeness at CIP review                                                                                           |
| CPS  | Cardano Problem Statement   | This is more of an operational change appropriate to Cardano Blockchain                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| LBC  | Lean Business Case          | A formatted proposal which outlines the reason or proposal, the value it brings, the driver. This may result in the creation of additional CIPs or CPSs to break down this LBC. Consult the [glossary ](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/glossary-intersect-all/blob/main/intersect%20glossary/creation-process.md)for detail of expectations of a valid LBC. |
| SEF  | Security or Emergency Fix   | This will follow an expedited route which is to be defined in conjunction with the Technical Steering Committee and Delivery Assurance                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Additional Notes and Guidance for LBC and SEF

The following items will be tested for eligibility, it should be noted that whilst a CPS or indeed LBC are not initially COREINF, the overall change could encompass required changes to COREINF to achieve this LBC

* Lean Business Case (LBC) - this is a formatted proposal which outlines the reason or proposal, the value it brings, the driver. This may result in the creation of additional CIPs or CPSs to break down this and deliver in logical phases
* Security or Emergency Fix (SEF) - an expedited route could result from a perceived threat, a behaviour observed and accelerated through a security or performance benchmark, such an item will be fast-tracked to ensure timely resolution

A separate [glossary ](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/glossary-intersect-all/blob/main/intersect%20glossary/creation-process.md)will be provided to house all the necessary attributes expected in this document. Once the glossary is set up, it will be linked to the relevant terms.
